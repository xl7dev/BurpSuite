"""Pseudo Terminal Device

    Pseudo terminals are a unique feature of UNIX, and always come in form of
    pairs of devices (/dev/ptyXX and /dev/ttyXX), which are connected to each
    other by the operating system. One may think of them as two serial devices
    linked by a null-modem cable. Being based on devices the number of
    simultanous instances of this class is (globally) limited by the number of
    those device pairs, which is 256.

    Another technic are UNIX 98 PTY's. These are supported also, and prefered
    over the (obsolete) predecessor.

    There's a sinister ioctl(2), signal(2) and job control stuff
    nessesary to make everything work as it should.

    Much of the stuff can be simplified by using openpty from glibc2.
    Compatibility issues with obsolete installations and other unixes
    may prevent this.

Based on the konsole code from Lars Doelle.
