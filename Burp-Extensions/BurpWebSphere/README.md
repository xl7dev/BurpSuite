WebSphere-Portlet-State-Decoder
===============================

WebSphere Portlet State Decoder plugin for Burp


Displays the decoded XML state in a new tab when the request is viewed. Upon clicking the tab, the plugin makes a request against an endpoint on the application server which decodes the URL, formats the resulting XML and displays it in the tab. 

Note: If the above wasn't clear, everytime you click the tab it will make a request against the app server, be mindful.
